# Usamune PC

This repo contains a (WIP) feature-complete port of the Usamune Practice ROM, developed by circumark994 and atmpas (https://sites.google.com/view/supermario64/usamunepj/usamunerom) to PC. This port is intended to be a part of the SM64 Speedrun project (https://github.com/wRadion/sm64-speedrun), a version of the SM64 PC port optimized for speedrunning.

## Building native executables

Follow all the instructions provided in https://github.com/wRadion/sm64-speedrun, but make sure that your base ROM has been patched prior to building - a link to the patcher is provided on the official Usamune ROM website (https://sites.google.com/view/supermario64/usamunepj/usamunerom).
